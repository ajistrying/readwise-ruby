He issued this decree on a Friday, right before he was to leave on a weeklong vacation. \u201cHe thought that was going to be hard,\u201d Radia says.

These paths couldn\u2019t loop\u2014no doubling back on the journey from point A to point B. Radia\u2019s algorithm automatically created routes for each packet based on a spanning tree, a kind of mathematical graph that connects points to one another with no redundancies. Not only did it solve the Ethernet problem but it was also infinitely scalable and self-healing: if one computer in the network goes down, as computers are wont to do, the spanning-tree protocol automatically determines a new route for the packet. This is Radia\u2019s signature touch. She designs systems that run with minimal intervention, through self-configuring and self-stabilizing behavior. This approach makes a large computer network like the Internet possible. As she said in 2014, \u201cWithout me, if you just blew on the Internet, it would fall over and die.\u201d Radia took the rest of the weekend off after inventing the spanning-tree protocol.
